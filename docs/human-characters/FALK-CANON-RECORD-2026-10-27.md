# FALK — CANON RECORD (design lock, 2026-10-27)

**Character:** Falk — Dojo 2 leader (Master Falk), Aero type, Wind
Fragment, Aero Dojo — Wind Wing, Stoneport area.

## The lock

The design generated in the Human Character Design Lane (Wave 1) from
`falk-brief-and-gaps-2026-10-27.md` was shown to the owner on
2026-10-27. **Owner verdict: the design is confirmed.** The cream
panels of the flight jacket were considered for a swap to red and the
owner rejected the swap — **the design stands exactly as designed;
colours are not altered.**

## Wardrobe ruling (owner, 2026-10-27)

The three verdict candidates are **the same man in three canon
outfits** — the show runs outfit/fashion variation. None of the three
is superseded; all three are kept, with scene roles:

| Outfit | Source plate | Worn for |
|---|---|---|
| **CASUAL** | Candidate A — cream-and-teal flight jacket, feather shoulder trim, short knotted scarf, goggles on forehead | Everyday presentation: model sheet, world views, walk, portrait |
| **FIELD** | Candidate B — sleeveless padded flight vest, thick falconry glove on left forearm | Out in the wild, battling away from the dojo |
| **DOJO** | Candidate C — deep teal flight jacket, long streaming scarf, calling pose | Dojo-leader presentation: battle front, dojo scenes |

## Locked look (one likeness across all outfits)

Face: youthful adult man, lean keen face, confident easy grin, small
nose, small mouth · Skin: warm medium-tan (as designed, confirmed
as-is) · Hair: tall swept-up-and-back spiky hair, golden blonde, bold
separated spikes (owner direction 2026-10-27: hairstyle like Lars
from Tekken — described, never named in prompts) · Eyes: large anime
eyes, sky-blue · Male (owner ruling 2026-10-27) · Dressed like an
avian trainer (owner direction 2026-10-27) · Signature items: aviator
goggles on forehead, teal scarf, belt pouch · No baked shadows.

## Team (owner ruling 2026-10-27 — locked reading wins)

019 Zephling Lv18 / 020 Aerobeak Lv19 / 021 Stormtalon Lv20
(Stormtalon below its Lv34 evolution threshold is a standing
exception in the locked reading; the Sproutle code placeholder is
superseded.) Dialogue APPROVED 2026-10-26
(`MASTER-FALK-DIALOGUE-DRAFT-2026-10-26.md`), built on the owner's
verbatim voice seeds: "I'm high as a kite", "free like a bird",
"I'm about to fly him out".

## Completion set (8-step standard) — status at lock

| # | Step | Status | Outfit |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Model sheet (this PR) | DONE | Casual |
| 2 | World front/back/left/right | DONE (lane workspace) | Casual |
| 3 | Walk frames | DONE — 4 direction idles + all four directional strides. The down/up step frames were missing at the lock (recorded missing, not fabricated) and were produced 2026-10-27 on the owner's order; see the gap-closure note below | Casual |
| 4 | Battle front | DONE (lane workspace). Battle back not owed: NPC front-facing per standard, not playable | **Dojo** (primary); casual variant supplementary, drift-flagged |
| 5 | Portrait icon | DONE (lane workspace; cropped from the locked model sheet) | Casual |
| 6 | Special variants | DONE as role variants per the wardrobe ruling — dojo presentation plate + field outfit plate; no bike/surf/etc. variants invented (he has no such canon action) | Dojo / Field |
| 7 | Data | DONE (lane workspace JSON: role, location, dialogue ref, party) | — |
| 8 | 64×64 atlas + manifest | DONE (lane workspace; complete atlas fills all 16 cells and supersedes the partial one; manifest records the outfit and source of every cell) | Mixed, per cell |

**Count: 8/8 steps complete.** (At the lock the count stood at 7/8
with step 3 partial — the walk generation had produced the four
direction idles and left/right strides, and the down/up step frames
were recorded missing, not fabricated. The owner ruled the frames
necessary on 2026-10-27; both were produced the same day in the
locked likeness and casual outfit, identity-checked against the
locked model sheet with a PASS, and the walk sheet and atlas were
rebuilt complete — `falk-walk-sheet-COMPLETE-2026-10-27.webp` and
`falk-atlas-64x64-COMPLETE-2026-10-27.png` supersede the partial
versions, which are kept on file. The full closure history,
including a flagged slight proportion nuance in the new frames,
is recorded in the step-8 manifest's `gap_closure` entry.) Full
set staged in the
Human Character Design Lane workspace
(`human-design-lane/wave-1/falk/completion/`): model sheet, world
views, walk sheet, battle fronts, portrait, data JSON, atlas PNG,
manifest JSON. Flagged drift on record: the casual battle variant
grins with teeth, streams the scarf long, and wears the pouch on the
right hip — kept as a supplementary variant only; the dojo battle
front is primary.

## Form split (owner ruling, 2026-10-27)

The owner reviewed the completed walk sheet and ruled that its
first figures are the **CHIBI form**. The two forms are now
separated and each completed in its own proportions; the atlas set
is **three atlases**:

| Atlas | Form | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `falk-atlas-64x64-COMPLETE-2026-10-27.png` | Mixed (historical set) | Retained unchanged |
| `falk-atlas-64x64-FULLSIZE-2026-10-27.png` | Full-size only | NEW — 16/16 cells |
| `falk-atlas-64x64-CHIBI-2026-10-27.png` | Chibi only | NEW — 16/16 cells |

Plus a full-size walk sheet, `falk-walk-sheet-FULLSIZE-2026-10-27.webp`
(4 directions × idle + step rows at model-sheet proportions).

**Classification was by eye, backed by measurement** — head share
(top of figure → neck/scarf line, as % of figure height), recorded
per cell in the step-8 manifest's `form_split` entry. Measured
bands: **full-size 18–28%**, **chibi 39–56%** — no overlap. The
walk sheet's pixel frames measure chibi (idles 39.0–44.5%),
confirming the owner's ruling; the gap-closure anime down/up steps
measure full-size-leaning (28.4% / 26.7%) and sit in the full-size
set. Gaps were filled with new generations (text-only, casual
outfit, no baked shadows): full-size left/right steps and a
full-size walk cycle; chibi down/up steps and a chibi six-figure
sheet (world views, dojo battle front, dojo presentation). All
passed the identity gate within their form. Two flags ride along,
recorded in the manifest: the full-size cycle's front/back figures
are stride poses (labelled as strides, not idles), and the chibi
front figure grins with teeth. Step 3 and step 8 stand DONE for
both forms; the canon count stays **8/8**.

**Form-split approval (owner, 2026-10-27; PR #430):** the full-size walk sheet, the FULLSIZE atlas, and the CHIBI atlas are APPROVED as presented — including the two flagged items that were in front of the owner: the chibi front figure's teeth grin (against the locked closed-mouth likeness) and the full-size cycle's front/back figures being labelled stride poses, not idles. The flags stay documented in the manifest, now as approved-as-presented.
