# UI Art Options — saved, not discarded (2026-10-25, UI Art lane)

Mars: keep ALL of these as options, build on them later, do NOT throw
them away even if a later direction is chosen. These are drafts /
reference images, NOT final game art, NOT in-game assets yet.
If a later direction fails, fall back to any option here.

## Options shown in this lane, 2026-10-25
1. verify-match-layout-v8.png — layout check, Pokemon boxes vs Mochiichao boxes, text boxes only. RETIRED as a visual (Mars: looks like terminal shit), KEPT as a layout reference.
2. mochiichao-game-look-v9.png — main menu + battle HUD mixed on one screen. WRONG MIX, DISCARDED as a screen, KEPT as an option for its game-look elements only (title, HP boxes, panels).
3. mochiichao-main-menu-only-v10.png — main menu ALONE, no battle elements. Current main-menu reference.
4. fire-red-first-replacement-log-v11.md — FireRed first, one-by-one, element -> replacement -> HAVE/NEED. Current working rule.
5. mochiichao-logo-draft-v1.png — logo draft v1: white fill, teal outline, gold shadow, DIAMOND VERSION below. Plain bold style.
6. mochiichao-logo-y2k-v2.png — logo Y2K draft v2: bubbly italic, cyan/blue gradient, white outline, stars, orbit ring.
7. mochiichao-logo-y2k-mixed-v3.png — logo Y2K mixed draft v3: black blocky + white outline + cyan/pink gradients + stars/hearts/swoosh, PLUS menu color map (Roster pink, Shop yellow, Bag green, Battle red, PC blue, Garden purple).
8. y2k-theme.md — Y2K theme spec, updated to mixed Y2K: glossy rounded panels, white border, soft glow, each menu a different neon/pastel color, Japanese Y2K anime feel (stars, hearts, flowers, swooshes, sparkles).
9. pokemon-vs-mochiichao-layout-v6.png — layout diagram v6, Pokemon left / Mochiichao right. Reference only, NOT a screenshot.
10. pokemon-version-wireframe-v7.png — wireframe v7, title / main menu / pause / battle / dialogue boxes. Reference only, NOT a screenshot, NOT game art.

## Earlier lane options (kept, not re-pushed here unless missing)
- cutouts/mochii-front-cut.png, dorowani-player-threequarter-right-cut.png, gabu-threequarter-left-cut.png — sheet cuts, canon likeness, NOT generated.
- cutout-menu.png — reference composite only, NOT the game.
- assets/svg/ 48 SVGs + manifest + mochiichao-ui.css — already on main via PR #14, do NOT re-upload over them.
- Retired AI mocks (title art, UI kit, main menu, battle HUD) — reference only, DRIFT, do NOT use as final assets. Title art is STOPPED (gold spikes / arm band) — do NOT re-upload.

## Push rules for this batch (Mars, 2026-10-25)
- Additions ONLY, 0 deletions, 0 overwrites. If a repo path already exists, SKIP it and report it, do NOT clobber it.
- Branch from current main, PR, gate-check, merge only if clean.
- No game code changes, no sprite-2d changes, no uiArt slot changes in this batch. Docs + option images only.
- Local copies stay at ~/workspace/mochiichao-work/ui-art/ regardless of PR outcome.

## Main menu step record — READ FIRST (added 2026-10-28)

The full step-by-step instruction record of this menu — V1 to V36,
Mars's instructions, measurements, phi fades, motion parameters,
and the locked v32 spec — is filed at
`docs/ui-art/main-menu-steps-v1-to-v36/` (README.md + STEPS.md +
EVIDENCE-INDEX.md). Standing rule: any agent touching the main
menu pulls that record up first and walks it step by step,
verbatim. No freehand remakes. The locked v32 facts are the floor.
