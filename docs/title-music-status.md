# Mochiichao Audio Status — chosen vs draft

Updated 2026-10-25, Title Music lane. This file is the single status record the
wiring agent must follow. If it conflicts with an older handoff, this file wins
until Mars changes it in his own words.

## Chosen (wire these, in these slots only)

- BOOT SOUND: UI Art Option B "rising arpeggio"
  (`boot-sound-option-b-rising-arpeggio.wav`, ~1.95 s) — boot slot only.
- PRESS-START SOUND: M3 "Mochii Chirp"
  (`public/audio/mochiichao-boot-M3-mochii-chirp.wav`, PR #36) — title press-start slot only.

## Saved as options, not chosen (do not wire)

- UI Art boot options A and C.
- Title Music boot options M1 "Data Spark" and M2 "Harbour Bell".

## Drafts (do not wire as final)

- Title v1 (`public/audio/mochiichao-title.wav`, PR #36) — draft, superseded by v2 draft.
- Intro v1 (`public/audio/mochiichao-intro.wav`, PR #36) — draft, superseded by v2 draft.
- Title v2 (`public/audio/mochiichao-title-v2.wav`, PR #59) — LOCKED DRAFT (Mars:
  "lock them in", 2026-10-25). Kept on main, not deleted, not replaced, not
  wired as final. See `docs/title-music-v2-spec.md`.
- Intro v2 (`public/audio/mochiichao-intro-v2.wav`, PR #59) — LOCKED DRAFT (same).
  See `docs/title-music-v2-spec.md`.
- Title v3 (`public/audio/mochiichao-title-v3.wav`, PR #70) — OFFICIAL TITLE
  TRACK (Mars, 2026-10-25: "those are awesome", save as official). Layered
  on v2 (guitar/synth/organ/sub-bass/hip-hop drums). See
  `docs/title-music-v3-spec.md` and `docs/game-music-production-conversation.md`.
- Intro v3 (`public/audio/mochiichao-intro-v3.wav`, PR #70) — OFFICIAL INTRO
  TRACK (same decision). Rap-like (bass/drums/guitar only, fewer layers
  than title). See `docs/title-music-v3-spec.md` and
  `docs/game-music-production-conversation.md`.

## Wiring (2026-10-25, wiring batch)

- Title v3, intro v3, main-menu v1: WIRED via `src/lib/music.ts`
  + `src/components/IntroSequence.tsx` phase effect + `src/App.tsx`
  world-entry stop. INTRO → intro one-shot, TITLE → title loop,
  MAIN_MENU/SETTINGS/SAVE_SLOTS → main-menu loop, later phases →
  music stops, world entry → music stops. Boot B + press-start M3
  were already wired on main in `src/lib/bootAudio.ts` before this
  batch (settled roles, not duplicated here).
- Main menu v1 (`public/audio/mochiichao-main-menu-v1.wav`): DRAFT, wired
  for testing. NOT official until Mars says so. See
  `docs/main-menu-spec.md` for its loop audit and style research.

## Rule

Show Mars the draft tracks first (playable live links, not download links, not
in-chat attachments) and keep working on everything else to 100% while waiting.
Nothing here is wired as final until Mars approves it after listening —
except title v3 / intro v3, which Mars made official on 2026-10-25.
