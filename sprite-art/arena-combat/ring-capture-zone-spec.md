# The Ringcade — ring-capture zone spec — retro-arcade-themed zone, ring mechanic unchanged (Mars, 2026-10-25 ~19:49 + ~19:51 + ~19:54 CDT; name decided ~21:18 CDT)

Status: SPEC + GATE CODE ONLY. No zone map, no shop UI, no art is built
here. The gate code lives in `captureLoop.js`
(`isRingCaptureUnlocked`, `consumeRingItem`); this spec is the design
that code gates. Standing scope rule applies: moves/animations come in
100%; the only exclusions are Pokemon creature names, sounds, art, and
dialogue — none of those appear here.

## 1. What changed, in order (so no earlier draft is mistaken for current)

- ~19:45 CDT: Mars said ring capture was NOT wanted; capture is normal
  Pokemon-style (Luigi Cubes in Mochiichao canon).
- ~19:49 CDT: refinement — ring capture RETURNS as an OPTIONAL,
  proprietary-to-Mochiichao system: a new zone introduces it, visiting
  + playing that zone unlocks it, shops then sell ring-capture items,
  and the player can ring-capture whenever they want afterwards.
  Default capture stays Luigi Cubes at all times.
- ~19:51 CDT: correction — the zone is NOT the Safari Zone. Mochiichao
  already has its own Safari/preserve area at Harbor City (five-region
  canon, Dojo 6 / Wave-Ride beat). The ring zone is a NEW, SEPARATE
  zone, and its name is arcade-evocative.
- ~19:54 CDT: theme correction, SUPERSEDING the arcade-as-mechanic
  reading — the arcade part is NAME AND THEME ONLY. The zone FEELS
  like walking into a game arcade full of retro games (cabinets, neon,
  retro-game scenery as the SETTING and VIBE), but it is called
  something DIFFERENT from "Arcade Zone". The ring capture MECHANIC
  itself STAYS ring capture (Mochiichao's own version), played inside
  that retro-arcade-themed zone. There is NO token economy, NO cabinet
  mini-game layer, and NO high-score scoring mechanic in this design —
  any earlier draft containing those is superseded and must not be
  implemented from.

## 2. Zone name — DECIDED BY MARS (2026-10-25 ~21:18 CDT): The Ringcade

Mars picked **The Ringcade**. Code and docs refer to the zone as
The Ringcade from here on.

## 3. Zone purpose, theme, and layout (concept, not a map)

- A standalone zone, separate from Harbor City's preserve. No preserve
  rules apply here (no step limits, no preserve-only creatures, no
  Wave-Ride gating).
- Purpose in one line: teach ring capture by playing it, then let the
  player take it outside.
- **Theme (setting only):** walking in feels like walking into a retro
  game arcade — rows of cabinets, neon signage, retro-game scenery and
  decor, arcade ambience. The cabinets are SCENERY: they are not
  playable mini-games, they cost nothing, they award nothing, and
  they do not teach or gate anything. If a player examines one, the
  most it does is describe the decor.
- Layout concept (for the overworld agent to build, not built here):
  an entrance, a practice area where the tutorial ring capture happens
  (§5), open floor space dressed with cabinet rows and neon, and an
  exit. No prize counter, no token exchange, no scoreboard — those
  belonged to the superseded mechanic reading and are NOT part of
  this zone.

## 4. Ring-capture items and shops

- **Ring-capture items** are ordinary shop stock, bought with regular
  currency — exactly like Luigi Cubes, not a zone currency. They are
  the physical items spent to attempt ring capture (§5).
- **Shops (outside the zone):** once unlocked (§6), ordinary shops
  stock ring-capture items alongside Luigi Cubes. Pricing hooks for
  the shop builder: a ring item should price ABOVE a standard Luigi
  Cube (it buys a second capture system, not a better ball — it does
  not raise capture rate) and BELOW a prime-tier cube (it must never
  become the strictly-best purchase). Exact prices are the shop
  builder's call; the gate code deliberately carries no prices.
- The zone itself does not need to sell anything. If the overworld
  agent places a shop inside the zone, that shop follows the same
  post-unlock stocking rule as every other shop.

## 5. How a ring-capture attempt works (mechanic unchanged)

1. The player opts into ring capture for an encounter (UI choice, not
   default). Starting the attempt spends 1 ring item
   (`consumeRingItem`) — exactly like throwing a ball spends a ball.
   If the player owns 0 ring items, or the zone unlock is absent, the
   option does not appear / is greyed out; normal capture is offered.
2. The attempt IS ring capture, Mochiichao's own version: the player
   traces rings around the wild creature. Each completed closed loop
   fills the capture gauge; the creature struggles, draining the
   gauge and breaking the in-progress ring; a matching-affinity ally
   assist multiplies loop gain (1.5x). A full gauge captures.
3. A broken attempt (gauge drained to 0 by struggles, or the player
   backing out) ends the attempt; the spent ring item is NOT refunded
   (same as a failed ball throw). The player may then throw a Luigi
   Cube or try again with another ring item.
4. Nothing about the attempt is scored, tokenised, or turned into a
   cabinet game. The retro arcade around it is where it happens,
   not what it is.

## 6. Unlock + shop flow (the gate, end to end)

```
visit zone            -> zoneVisited = true
complete tutorial     -> zonePlayed = true   (one full practice capture)
buy items in shops    -> ringItems > 0
ALL THREE             -> isRingCaptureUnlocked() = true -> ring option live
any one missing       -> ring option unavailable; Luigi Cubes unaffected
```

- The tutorial is mandatory the first visit: the player cannot leave
  with the unlock until they have completed one full practice capture
  in the zone's practice area (practice captures never enter the
  party — they are teaching only).
- Flags persist on the save (same save fields the game already uses
  for unlocks; the field names above are the code's `unlock` object
  keys, not a save-format mandate).
- The unlock is permanent once earned. It is never revoked by leaving
  the zone, spending down to 0 items (the option simply greys out
  until restocked), or entering the Harbor City preserve.
- Default capture never changes: at every step above, including
  before the zone exists in the player's path, Luigi Cube capture
  works exactly as before and is the only capture offered.

## 8. Research addendum — 2026-10-25 sweep: what was newly found, what it improves, where it got wired in

Sources actually read this pass (no guessed citations): the repo's own
decomp files — FireRed `src/safari_zone.c` (flag-gated zone mode,
session inventory cleared on exit) and HeartGold
`src/battle_arcade_game_board.c` (a 4x4 panel board, 16 panels, cursor
selection) — plus public design writing on ability-gating (optional
abilities must not gate the main path; teach by ramping) and public
Safari documentation (Kanto: 30 balls + step limit; Johto: no step
limit, leave by retiring / walking out / running out of balls).

What each find improved, and where it went:

1. **Persistent unlock vs session state (FireRed Safari flag pattern).**
   FireRed gates its zone with a mode flag and zeroes session counters
   on exit. Wired in as a HARD RULE in code, not just prose:
   `captureLoop.js` now exports `createRingUnlock`,
   `visitRingZone`, `playRingZone` (pure, non-mutating) — the unlock
   object is persistent save state, an encounter object is session
   state, and leaving the zone discards the encounter without ever
   clearing flags. Tests assert spending never clears flags and that
   0 items only greys the option out until restocked (§6 updated by
   this rule). What was NOT copied: Safari's step limit and
   zone-only balls — our zone deliberately has neither (see 3).
2. **Optional-ability rule (public ability-gating writing).** Optional
   abilities must never gate the main path, or the game soft-locks
   players who miss them. Wired in as §6's standing rule, now stated
   explicitly: the ring unlock is NEVER on the critical path — no
   story beat, badge, or area may require ring capture, and no
   creature may be obtainable ONLY by ring capture. If a future
   design puts ring capture on the main path, that design conflicts
   with this spec and needs Mars's call.
3. **No step limit, no zone-only balls (Johto Safari precedent).**
   Johto's Safari variant dropped the step limit entirely (exit by
   retiring, walking out, or running out of balls). That precedent
   supports our deliberate divergence from Kanto Safari: our zone has
   no step limit and ring items are ordinary shop stock usable
   anywhere after unlock — not a zone-only currency. Stated here so a
   future builder does not "fix" these back toward Kanto rules.
4. **Tutorial ramp (teach-by-ramping writing).** The tutorial must
   ramp, not just demonstrate: practice capture 1 uses a slow-moving
   practice creature with a forgiving struggle rate; only after a
   full clean capture does the tutorial offer a standard-speed
   practice round (optional, before the unlock is granted — the
   unlock requires ONE full practice capture, §6, not both rounds).
   Wired into §6's tutorial paragraph as a staging requirement for
   the overworld agent.
5. **4x4 panel floor motif (HeartGold Battle Arcade board, THEME ONLY).**
   The arcade board's 4x4 grid of panels is borrowed as FLOOR
   DRESSING only: the zone floor may use a 4x4 glowing-panel grid
   motif in its tiling, and zone signage may echo panel shapes.
   The board's selection/roulette MECHANIC is explicitly NOT borrowed
   — panels are never selectable, never randomise anything, and never
   affect capture. This is the line the ~19:54 correction draws, and
   this motif stays on the theme side of it.
6. **Searched and NOT wired (stated so it is not re-proposed silently).**
   Bait/rock-style flee manipulation from Safari encounters: rejected
   — ring capture already has its own tension (meter vs struggle)
   and adding a second flee lever would muddy it. Cabinet fees,
   token payouts, and scoreboards: rejected per the ~19:54 correction
   (mechanic reading superseded). Battle Arcade roulette outcomes
   affecting capture: rejected for the same reason.

## 9. What is NOT in this batch (separate work, not silently assumed)

- The zone map, arcade dressing/art, tutorial script, shop UI and
  shop prices, and any creature roster for the zone. The overworld
  agent owns the zone; the shop builder owns prices; the Creature
  Mode lane owns real-time fight-as-creature wiring
  (see `follower/FIGHT-AS-CREATURE-SPEC.md`).
- No franchise names, sounds, art, or dialogue are used anywhere in
  this spec or the gate code. "Safari" above refers only to
  Mochiichao's own Harbor City preserve, to say the ring zone is
  NOT it.
- Explicitly NOT built, per the ~19:54 correction: token economy,
  token-to-item exchange, cabinet mini-games, cabinet fees, and
  high-score scoring. If any of those appear in another lane's work
  as part of ring capture, that work conflicts with this spec and
  needs Mars's call before it ships.
