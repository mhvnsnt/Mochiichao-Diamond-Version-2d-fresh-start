/**
 * TitleCreatureFigure — the other 9/10 title rotation creatures
 * (Mars, 2026-10-25). Yogiferno keeps its own wrapper
 * (YogifernoTitleWalk, PR #33, fire trail on); this wrapper covers
 * the remaining pool, in rotation order, with no fire trail.
 *
 * Each figure is that creature's own Mochiichao 2D sheet, cut to a
 * single walking/standing figure with a scripted pass only
 * (border flood-fill, white-fringe decontamination, 1px alpha
 * feather — the same pass Mars confirmed good for Mochiichao and
 * that produced Yogiferno v2). No Pokemon creature art, no
 * hand-painted figure, no generated likeness.
 *
 * - Mochii: the Mars-confirmed cutout, copied as-is
 *   (380x380, transparent, blue water blob with wave pattern).
 * - Razorgater: 265x266, steel crocodile, front. Baked
 *   ground shadow removed (rembg u2netp, 2026-10-25 fix;
 *   GrabCut left the shadow in and was rejected for him).
 *   Eye-colour drift NOT decided here (main sheet red eyes
 *   vs angles sheets blue eyes — Mars to pick).
 * - Tyrage: 327x305, front, ground cracks from the sheet remain.
 *   White spot between feet removed, baked shadow removed
 *   (rembg u2netp, 2026-10-25 white-spot/shadow fix).
 * - Kittember: 287x304, front, ember tail orb in the cutout.
 *   White wedge between head and tail removed, baked shadow
 *   removed (rembg u2netp, 2026-10-25 fix; two tiny satellite
 *   bubbles lost their orange fill in the model pass, noted).
 *   Glow cycle (2026-10-26 wiring, docs/kittember-glow-cycle-
 *   wiring-20261026.md): A off -> B glow (the PR #162 shipped
 *   cutout, reused as-is) -> C stronger -> B -> A, 500ms per
 *   frame, 2500ms loop. The v2 glow rebuild (B2/C2, blur +
 *   whiter core) stays staged only — this wiring uses the v1
 *   cycle Mars was shown, not the v2 frames.
 * - Sproutle: 259x333, front, goggles + shell. White spot
 *   between feet removed, baked shadow removed
 *   (rembg u2netp, 2026-10-25 fix).
 * - Dorowani: 263x398, front (sheet cell 2,0). White spot
 *   between legs removed, baked shadow removed
 *   (OpenCV GrabCut, 2026-10-25 fix — u2netp damaged her belly
 *   and was rejected for her, GrabCut was clean).
 * - Gabu: 292x295, front (sheet cell 2,0, grid-line inset).
 * - Wispkin: 288x609, V1 sheet only — white cracked skull face,
 *   black drop body, wisp smoke. Duskfiend is NOT in this pool.
 * - Mythar: 434x350, front, stained-glass wings + halo ring.
 *
 * Shadow note: Tyrage, Kittember, Sproutle, Dorowani and
 * now Razorgater no longer carry a baked sheet shadow
 * (2026-10-25 fixes above; Pokemon-first: FireRed draws
 * shadow as a separate 32x8 sprite, gEnemyMonShadow_Gfx /
 * PALTAG_SHADOW, not baked into the battler sprite —
 * engine-drawn shadow is the later layer, not claimed here).
 * Wispkin (wisp smoke), Mythar (halo ring) and Yogiferno
 * (fire halo) carry design elements, not ground shadows,
 * verified on black; Gabu was confirmed fine by Mars and
 * is untouched. No title cutout in the 10-pool now carries
 * a baked ground shadow.
 * Biome assignment (title-backgrounds batch, 2026-10-25; corrected
 * by Mars ~23:44 CDT, plus batch 6 (2026-10-26): each creature
 * now shows on its own card from titleCardEffects
 * (primaryCardForCreature), with its per-card effect and its own
 * action burst. Wispkin is on night (purple), Dorowani on water,
 * Mochii on rain; Gabu is on forest (Mars-confirmed 2026-10-26:
 * "Gabu is good for forest"); Mythar has his OWN pearlescent
 * diamond-pearl card (sparkles + sine waves, per Mars's own
 * description); Kittember has his OWN lantern-night card
 * (lanterns illuminating + Kittember's ember illuminating).
 * 10 cards, 10 creatures, one per card, no card empty.
