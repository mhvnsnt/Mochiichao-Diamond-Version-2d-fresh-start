/**
 * combatAiming.ts — Phase 3 combat aiming + camera presets (NEW, 2026-10-26).
 *
 * The FireRed aiming model, as inventoried from the decomp code on disk
 * (battle_anim_mons.c battler anchors + battle_anim_utility_funcs.c
 * side-mirroring), with Black 2's battler tables for the 3D anchor set:
 *
 *   origin    = sideAnchor + sideSign x scriptOffset
 *   direction = targetAnchor - origin
 *
 * sideSign: player +1, foe -1. A script offset is written in
 * attacker-facing space (positive = toward the target), so the foe's
 * offset is negated on screen — that negation is the whole reason an
 * opponent attack travels TOWARD the player side instead of mirroring
 * the player's up-right angle. Pokemon does NOT hardcode 45 degrees:
 * the FireRed single-battle anchors give player->foe atan2(-40, 104)
 * = about -21 degrees (up-right, y down), foe->player about 159 degrees
 * (down-left, toward the player side). The 45-degree cell rendering is
 * Mars's rule on top of this direction, owned by the VFX/aimfix pass,
 * not by this module.
 *
 * ORIGIN / ANGLE TABLE PATH (the sibling origin/angle worker's table
 * lands here; this module defines the contract it must satisfy):
 *   src/lib/generated/combatOriginAngleTable.json
 * Until per-move body-part offsets exist, every entry carries offset
 * [0, 0] — battler-centre origin, exactly what the inventory proved:
 * no generation on disk has a per-move mouth/hand/cannon table, and
 * this module invents none. A missing entry falls back to centre too,
 * never to a guessed body part. The staged v1 table (36 centre entries
 * for the original 36 game moves; batch-2 moves fall back to centre
 * per the module rule) is verified against these anchors by
 * combatPhase3.test.ts.
 *
 * Camera: battles are turn-based core with XD/Colosseum-style camera
 * LANGUAGE (wide establishing shot, attacker close-up on windup,
 * impact shake, return to wide). The live canvas is Pixi 2D, not a 3D
 * engine, so these presets are a framing vocabulary, not a 3D camera:
 * PixiBattleCanvas already implements them through battleTreatments
 * sampling (attacker cameraZoom on windup, sampled shake on impact).
 * This module names the presets so a future 3D canvas can consume the
 * same phase vocabulary without re-deriving it.
 *
 * This module is pure: no imports, no DOM, no game state. PixiBattleCanvas
 * imports it (the live direction wiring); combatPhase3.ts documents the
 * full seven-system chain around it.
