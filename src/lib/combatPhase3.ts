/**
 * combatPhase3.ts — Phase 3 combat wiring, in Pokemon's order (NEW, 2026-10-26).
 *
 * This module EXTENDS the live base; it does not redo it and does not
 * replace the resolver. Live BattleView already resolves turns through
 * battleResolver.resolveTurn (PR #107) on top of battle-math.ts, so
 * systems 2-4 and 7 below were already live before this file existed —
 * this module names them, pins their locked values, and adds the two
 * pieces that were missing: the singles target table (5) and the
 * unified move-schema + script-routing accessor (1). Direction (part of
 * 6) is live in PixiBattleCanvas through combatAiming.ts; the camera
 * preset vocabulary (6) lives there too.
 *
 * The seven systems, in Pokemon's order, with their live status:
 *   (1) Move schema — FireRed shape (effect/power/type/accuracy/PP/
 *       secondary-chance/target/priority/flags) for the 122 game moves
 *       in moves.ts, plus the 563-key union script table in
 *       moveScripts.json. gameMoveSchema() routes a game move to its
 *       union script through gameMoveScriptMap.json (86/121 on main:
 *       10 exact-id + 76 mapped, 35 named-unrouted — verified against live
 *       main 2026-10-27, not from a local clone).
 *   (2) Effect dispatch — resolver effect kinds (none/status/stat/
 *       recoil/multiHit/highCrit/chargeTurn/flinch), applied by
 *       resolveTurn in pipeline order (can-act -> charge -> accuracy
 *       -> damage -> secondary -> recoil -> faint -> end-turn ticks).
 *       35 of the 43 distinct effect strings in moves.ts map to a live
 *       kind (the batch-3 pool completion added 15 stat/recoil tokens,
 *       all dispatched through the existing stat/recoil kinds); the
 *       other 8 (ALL_UP1, CONFUSE, DRAIN, FORM_TYPE, FREEZE, PROTECT,
 *       SLEEP, TRAP) have no resolver kind -- FORM_TYPE is realized in
 *       mytharPick.ts instead, the other 7 are named as pending in the
 *       test, never silent (see test).
 *   (3) Turn order — priority first, then effective Speed (stage-
 *       adjusted, paralysis quarters), then a coin flip on an exact
 *       tie (battle-math orderPair, via resolver orderActions).
 *   (4) Accuracy / crit / damage — battle-math: accuracy threshold
 *       from acc/eva stages, crit LOCKED at x2 with the stage table
 *       {16, 8, 4, 3, 2} (1-in-N), crit ignores the attacker's negative
 *       Atk stage and the defender's positive Def stage, base damage
 *       floored at each division step, STAB x1.5, roll 85-100 last.
 *       The old flat 6% / x1.5 crit is gone from this path.
 *   (5) Targets — singles table below: 35 moves target the foe, and
 *       EARTH_TREMOR targets allFoes (its game text is "all adjacent
 *       foes"). The resolver collapses allFoes to the foe in a 1v1,
 *       so singles behaviour is unchanged today and doubles-ready
 *       tomorrow. battleWiring.buildLegacyMoveTable() applies this
 *       override live; this table is its source of truth.
 *   (6) Camera — combatAiming.ts presets (wide / attacker close-up /
 *       impact shake / return to wide), XD/Colosseum-style framing
 *       language on the Pixi 2D canvas (not a true 3D camera — the
 *       game canvas is Pixi 2D, stated plainly).
 *   (7) HP drain — HP changes ONLY at the impact frame (BattleView
 *       onAttackImpact, driven by Pixi onImpact) or in a resolver
 *       event (damage / recoil / end-turn tick). Between-turn movement
 *       (battleIntegration.sampleBetweenTurnPose) is pose-only and
 *       moves 0 HP: hpUnchangedOutsideTurn() is the guard, and the
 *       Arena rule is absolute — no fighting move lands between turns.
 *
 * NOT in this phase (stated, not hidden): doubles target selection
 * (adjacent pick, Follow-Me / Lightning-Rod redirection), a true 3D
 * camera, True-Elements chart wiring (list locked at 19, matchup
 * values still owed — another lane owns it; the legacy chart stays
 * live here), union-move display names (the sibling rename map, not
 * yet landed — union keys here are decomp constants, never shown as
 * game-facing names), and per-move mouth/hand origins (sibling
 * origin/angle tables; v1 entries here are battler-centre).
 *
 * Proprietary rule governing this file (2026-10-26 ~20:39 CDT): only
 * species/characters, names, images, logos, literal dialogue and
 * cries are swapped out. Move structure, order, windows, inputs and
 * values are wired as Pokemon does them; no town names are used here.
