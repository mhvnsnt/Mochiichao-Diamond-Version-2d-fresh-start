/**
 * Start-screen playback resolution — saved preset -> TITLE phase.
 *
 * Batch: playback of a saved Start Screen preset in Pixi (spec
 * section 2, after creator batch E / PR #44). This module is the
 * resolution logic only; src/components/game/StartScreenPlayer.tsx
 * does the Pixi rendering. It does NOT touch IntroSequence audio,
 * SettingsScreen rows, or the locked v32 main-menu layout.
 *
 * Resolution rules (task-settled, not invented here):
 *   - The most recently saved user preset plays. "Most recent" is
 *     the user preset with the largest savedAt; ties fall to the
 *     last one in stored order. The locked default is NEVER a
 *     "saved" preset and is never overwritten.
 *   - The locked default plays when no saved user preset exists.
 *   - Per-field fallback: any missing/invalid preset field falls
 *     back to the locked default's value for THAT field only —
 *     the rest of the preset still plays. Never crash, never blank.
 *   - Layout is always the locked layout: a stored layout that
 *     disagrees with LOCKED_START_SCREEN_LAYOUT is discarded in
 *     full (move = Layout Editor, restyle = UI Creator — the PR #44
 *     preset schema carries no layout-editor offsets or UI-creator
 *     restyle fields, and none are invented here).
 *
 * Show-first compliance (Mars, 2026-10-25 ~20:40 CDT, standing):
 *   - Creatures: only Yogiferno has shipped art that this player
 *     may draw (PR #33 v1 clean cutout, via the availability flag
 *     in startScreenPreset.ts). The other 9 pool names render a
 *     labelled GAP box in the player — no fake art, no invented
 *     creature art, and the 9 cutout PNGs that landed on main from
 *     a parallel lane are NOT referenced here until Mars has seen
 *     the actual images.
 *   - Painted backgrounds: the 8 painted title-bg-*-v2.png files
 *     on main are NOT drawn by this player until Mars has seen
 *     the actual PNGs. A 'painted' preset choice renders a labelled
 *     slate fallback + GAP label, never a fake painting.
 *   - Audio: this batch wires NO audio. The start-screen MUSIC
 *     slot is name only and empty (GAP), like PR #63 did for music.
 *     The settled BOOT Option B / PRESS-START M3 roles are already
 *     wired on main (PR #79, bootAudio.ts via advanceIntro) —
 *     no second audio path is created here, and that audio code
 *     (and advanceIntro) is not edited.
 *   - Fonts: the DIAMOND VERSION subtitle font stays PINNED
 *     (PINNED_SUBTITLE_FONT, never redefined or restyled here).
 *     Behance Kilo/Roadam files and the custom logo font are NOT
 *     shipped or referenced.
 *
 * No Pokemon sprites, dialogue, music, or cries — structure
 * translated only, Mochiichao wording/art only.
