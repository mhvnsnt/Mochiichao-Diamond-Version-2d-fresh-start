/**
 * Human sprite loader — same contract as the creature sheet loader, and
 * deliberately NOT creature-only: every human in the game goes through
 * here, so a sheet arriving from the Human Characters lane is a file
 * swap, not a code change.
 *
 * Format (same as creatures, extended for humans): a sheet image plus a
 * manifest with 64x64 cells — world front/back/left/right, walk
 * up/down/left/right (walk frames reuse the standing frame until the
 * lane delivers walk cycles), battle back (player trainer) / front
 * (opponent trainer), and a menu/portrait icon cell.
 * Until a sheet arrives, the slot's sheetUrl is null and the loader
 * renders a marked human silhouette placeholder (original coloured
 * shape, not an emoji) in the slot's colour.
 *
 * Player A swap (2026-10-25, Mars-approved): Player A is a young Black
 * woman, teal/chrome jacket. The game has boy/girl slots only (no
 * A/B/C/D picker yet), so Player A is wired to the player_girl slot —
 * choosing GIRL shows Player A art in world + battle. Her atlas is a
 * 256x256 4-column grid (not a 192x64 strip): row 0 = world
 * front/back/left/right, rows 1-2 = walk idle/step frames, row 3 =
 * battle_back + portrait. Walk cells are wired by PixiWorldCanvas
 * for the moving player (see walk on HumanSlot); battle_back (cell
 * 12) is wired by BattleView's player figure and portrait (cell 13)
 * is wired by DialogueBox's speaker portrait (see battleCell /
 * portraitCell on HumanSlot) — except Player A's portrait, which is
 * deliberately WITHHELD below: her portrait cell carries the flagged
 * eye drift, so her dialogue keeps the row-0 front until the Human
 * lane delivers a corrected portrait or Mars decides.
 * Portrait eye drift, noted not fixed: portrait v1 eyes drifted to
 * teal/blue; model/walk eyes are brown and brown is canon. The atlas
 * was NOT hand-edited to fix eyes; correction is a full-stack edit
 * later, and portrait eye colour must not be locked as canon.

// do not merge this file before the art-ship PR. Every staged
// manifest lists cells 0-13 only (256x256, 14 cells): world 0-3,
