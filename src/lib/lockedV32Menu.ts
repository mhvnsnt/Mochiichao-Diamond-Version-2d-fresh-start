/**
 * Locked v32 main menu — the WHOLE menu as data (2026-10-26 layer fix).
 *
 * Mars's rule (2026-10-26 09:26 CDT): a saved preset / restore is NOT
 * a static render and NOT a partial reset. It must be every
 * hand-built thing stored as data the game loads, so selecting it
 * restores all of it exactly. This module is that data for the main
 * menu itself: canvas, logo, cloud, Mochii cue, panels, background
 * layers, and symbol animation — the values Mars locked 2026-10-25
 * 16:47 CDT (layout) and 17:12 CDT (animation), copied exactly, not
 * redesigned. MAIN_MENU and MainMenuBackground render FROM this
 * object; nothing about the locked menu lives only in JSX literals
 * any more.
 *
 * What this module does NOT yet do (honest gap, follow-up PR — see
 * docs/locked-default-title-menu.md "Full snapshot preset gap"):
 * selecting a preset from Settings does not yet swap this object.
 * The settings-store fields (font rows, cursor, sound, button mode,
 * frame, themes) already live in GameSettings / LOCKED_PRESET and
 * already restore through Settings' RESET row. What is missing is
 * (a) a persisted active-menu-config field in the store holding a
 * menu definition like this one, (b) MAIN_MENU reading that field
 * instead of importing this constant directly, and (c) a Settings
 * row that writes this locked definition into the store. Until that
 * follow-up lands, do NOT claim a Settings-selectable full restore
 * exists: the default code path renders this locked data, which is
 * a restore point in code, not yet a selectable snapshot.

  // Mars's upload letters, keyed from black, with the v32 picture's

  // orbit ring (centre (619,472), a=425, b=186, stroke 30, thin white

  // round-2 ring (618,500,440,200) was re-fitted from clean strips
  // and corrected to the values above. The previous build's keyed upload
  // (src/assets/ui/mochiichao-main-logo.png: thin white orbit, no

  // rejected on his phone 2026-10-26 12:38 CDT, and it is NOT reused
  // for the main menu. TITLE keeps the original upload import
  // (IntroSequence line ~390, dark title background, where the thin
  // white orbit reads correctly); only the MAIN_MENU slot uses the
  // orbitfix asset. Asset canvas 900x548 = this slot exactly.
  // (Comment restored from merged PR #215 in commit 3 of this PR:
  // the cut base predated #215, so this comment — comment-only, no

  // Cloud VISIBLE-shape box (locked spec + v21 step): the visible cloud
  // shape spans x250-950, y648-828, centre (600,738), 700x180.
  // imgBox is the element box that puts the ORIGINAL puffy-cloud.svg
  // visible path exactly on that box. The file's visible path fills only
  // 88.3% of its viewBox width (path x10-540 of 600) and 73.2% of its
  // height (path y40-245 of 280), so rendering it fill into the 700x180
  // box showed a 341-wide cloud centred at x583, 132 tall — 17px left
  // and 48px short (measured in render, not from the box).
  // TWO measured rendering facts (Chrome, verified in a standalone
  // render of this exact element AND in the menu render, which agree):
  // (1) a plain <img> applies the SVG's default meet inside the box and
  // letterboxes the viewBox (imgBox 792x246 alone landed 378-844 wide,
  // not 250-950); (2) an <svg><image preserveAspectRatio="none">
  // does NOT stretch to the frame either — it renders the content at
  // 0.851 x frame width, centred 0.044 x frame width LEFT of the frame
  // centre, 0.671 x frame height tall, top at 0.191 x frame height
  // (measured: 674-wide content in a 792 frame, stroke 260-934 in the
  // menu, centre 597 — centred right but 25px narrow).
  // imgBox (225,599,823x258) is therefore the CALIBRATED frame that
  // lands the content on the locked box under fact (2):
  // width 823 x 0.851 = 700, centre 636.5 - 0.044 x 823 = 600,
  // height 258 x 0.671 = 173, top 599 + 0.191 x 258 = 648.
  // SHAPE TRANSFORM, NOT A REDRAW (Mars 2026-10-26 18:13 CDT): the file
  // is untouched; only its rendered scale/position change.
  // File untouched. BANNED / DO NOT USE: mochiichao-main-cloud-v32.svg
  // (the #184 trace) — deleted from main by Mars's order 2026-10-26;
  // it is NOT the cloud file and must never be rendered again.
  // EXACT-TARGET RETUNE (2026-10-26, Mars 19:57 CDT bar: the corrected
  // cloud must look like the TARGET panel EXACTLY, not close, not
  // 99.9%): the fixed3 frame above landed interior 258-942 x 653-811
  // in the app render and 258-942 x 654-816 for the isolated element
  // — both short of target interior 257-942 x 655-815. DECOMP CHECK
  // FIRST (Pokemon-first, FireRed then HeartGold then Black 2): NO
  // decomp pins a menu-cloud placement for this element — FireRed
  // title_screen.c has flame/leaf/slash sprites + background bitmaps
  // (no cloud sprite), main_menu.c has text window templates (no
  // cloud), HeartGold title_screen.c has zero 'cloud' matches (3D
  // scene; any clouds are baked into model/texture assets), Black 2
  // src has no title/menu cloud placement. The 250-950 x 648-828 box
  // is the Mochiichao v21 spec value, NOT a decomp value — stated
  // plainly. So the frame below is tuned by isolated-element
  // measurement (same white-interior flood method that reproduces
  // the picture's target interior 257-942 x 655-815 exactly as the
  // largest enclosed component): frame (224,601,825x254) renders
  // isolated interior 257-942 x 655-815 (685x160) — all four edges
  // EXACT, stroke 249-951 x 649-820 (within 1px of the picture's
  // stroke on every edge; that 1px is edge-threshold, not shape —
  // same file, same stretch mode, same shape).
  // APP CORRECTION (2026-10-26, measured in the true 1200x1500 app
  // render): the isolated rig's interior bottom (815) is the CENTRE
  // bottom, which the CONTINUE panel hides in the game — so in the
  // app the visible interior bottom is the LOBES, and the picture's
  // lobes sit 6px lower than the element's (picture right-lobe stroke
  // 819 vs element 813, left 813 vs ~807; app right-lobe stroke
  // measured IDENTICAL to isolated, 813, same taper — so the app
  // element is exact and the picture's cloud is a uniform vertical
  // stretch x1.039 about the top: interior height 160 vs 154,
  // (819-649)/(813-649) = 1.037). Frame (224,599,825x264) applies
  // that stretch in the app: predicted interior 257-942 x 655-815,
  // right-lobe stroke ~819, left-lobe stroke ~813, top/left/right
  // unchanged (width unchanged, top re-anchored: 599 + 0.191x264).
  // Verified by app re-render + measurement, not by the isolated
