"""WIELDER chat launcher — Chainlit entry point at the package root.

Run from the package root (show/production/wielder/ once landed):
    chainlit run chat_app.py --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8897
The handlers live in wielder/chat.py; importing that module registers
them with Chainlit. This file exists so the app launches as a plain
file while the package keeps its relative imports.

Chat commands (all rendered from the ledger / queue / verifier
manifest — see wielder/chat.py): run, run card <id>, board, timeline
<run_id>, packet <run_id>, gates, resumable, resume <run_id>,
checkpoints <run_id>, grants / grant <class> / revoke <id>; any other
message becomes a queue card.
