# HARVEST STATUS — scene kernel output download blocked again (new attempt, 2026-10-28)

## Outcome
STOPPED per the standing 429 rule. Two harvest calls in this attempt, both
429. No further Kaggle requests were made after the second 429 — no retry,
no alternate endpoint, no seg3 work. `scene-raw/` is empty (0 files).

## Exact errors (verbatim CLI output, both calls)

Attempt 1 — started 2026-10-28T10:07:31Z (after a ~12-minute pre-wait,
09:55:29Z–~10:07:29Z):

```
429 Client Error: Too Many Requests for url: https://api.kaggle.com/v1/kernels.KernelsApiService/ListKernelSessionOutput

You have been rate limited. Wait a little while before retrying.
```
CLI exit code 1. `scene-raw/` total 0.

Retry 1 (the single permitted retry, after a 15-minute wait
10:08:32Z–~10:23:32Z) — started 2026-10-28T10:23:34Z, command run ended
2026-10-28T10:24:34Z:

```
429 Client Error: Too Many Requests for url: https://api.kaggle.com/v1/kernels.KernelsApiService/ListKernelSessionOutput

You have been rate limited. Wait a little while before retrying.
```
CLI exit code 1. `scene-raw/` total 0.

For reference, the previous attempt's identical 429 was at 09:52 UTC the
same day (TEST-REPORT.md §6).

## Local prep — verified in this attempt (no Kaggle involved)
- `python3 -m py_compile postprocess.py build_seg3.py` — OK, no syntax errors.
- Background plate exists: 
  `~/workspace/mochiichao-show/repo-add/show/episodes/EP01/animatic/EP01-CUT01-composite-life-proof-v1.mp4`
  — 488,726 bytes, md5 `d2f1bf1d709d3a0e9d9d0f58dccc6c31` (matches the
  expected/registry md5 exactly), ffprobe: h264, 1280×720, 24 fps,
  192 frames, 8.0 s.
- Canon cutouts present: `~/workspace/mochiichao-show/canon-cutouts/wispkin.png`
  (129,111 bytes), `~/workspace/mochiichao-show/canon-cutouts/dorowani.png`
  (123,418 bytes).
- Postprocess dependencies present on disk: `white_matte.py`,
  `verify_proof.py`, `likeness_gate.py`; `ffmpeg`/`ffprobe` on PATH;
  Kaggle CLI 2.2.5 at `~/opt/tools/kaggle-venv/bin/kaggle` (not invoked
  again after the second 429).

## What was NOT done (blocked on the harvest, nothing else)
- No segment MP4s downloaded, so: no ffprobe of the 4 segments, no reading
  of `scene-run-report.json` (RIFE outcome still unknown), no
  `postprocess.py` run, no TEST-SCENE.mp4 / contact-sheet.png, no track
  measurements, no likeness/seam numbers, no frame-1 verdicts for the
  scene tracks.
- Seg3 follow-up NOT started (it depends on harvested seg2 last frames).

## Resume commands (run in a NEW attempt, after the rate limit clears)
```bash
cd ~/workspace/avatar-tool-build/test-scene
~/opt/tools/kaggle-venv/bin/kaggle kernels output marsfmmg/mochiichao-wan-scene-test -p scene-raw --force \
  --file-pattern ".*(\.mp4|scene-run-report\.json|run-report\.json|\.log)"
# then:
ls -lh scene-raw && cat scene-raw/scene-run-report.json
python3 postprocess.py
# then seg3 (build_seg3.py extracts seg2 last frames, writes scene-job3/):
python3 build_seg3.py
~/opt/tools/kaggle-venv/bin/kaggle datasets version -p scene-job3 -m "seg3 follow-up job"
~/opt/tools/kaggle-venv/bin/kaggle kernels push -p scene-kernel
```
Note: the dataset-version / kernel-push lines above are the standard
Kaggle CLI form for the existing dataset `marsfmmg/mochiichao-scene-job`
and kernel `marsfmmg/mochiichao-wan-scene-test` recorded in
`scene-kernel/kernel-metadata.json` / `scene-job/dataset-metadata.json`;
they were NOT run in this attempt (all Kaggle work stopped at the 429).

## Update — corrective pass, 2026-10-28 (~12:52–12:54 UTC)

The resume command was run in a new attempt. The four segment MP4s
downloaded completely (see TEST-REPORT §9 / CORRECTIVE-RUN §2 for
hashes). The same listing call then hit 429 again before the JSON
reports downloaded, and all Kaggle calls stopped per the standing
rule. Still outstanding from this kernel's outputs: only
`scene-run-report.json` / `run-report.json` (the RIFE record).
