# THE ED GAG FORMAT — "THE CHIBI WALK" — Mochiichao Show

**Status: STANDING FORMAT — owner-defined 2026-10-27.**
This document is the production record of the end-credits gag
format for the season's EDs. The format is the owner's, dictated
2026-10-27; it resolves the EP01 credits slot's PENDING OWNER
state at the format level. Per-episode contents vary under the
format; the format itself is standing until the owner changes it.

The gag lives in the ED's chibi credits-bit slot — the one
credits bit per episode the Chibi Card System permits
(CHIBI-CARD-SYSTEM.md). Chibi law still governs the bit: chibi
forms are proportion variants of the canon full-size likenesses,
chibi carries identity and flair only, and no shadow is baked
into character art (shadows are a composite-stage job).

---

## 1. THE SHAPE

The gag is a **side-view line**: a human character in front,
their party of Mochiichao trailing behind them in a line,
walking across the frame. The tone is mischievous chibi comedy.

Inspiration is tone and shape only. No character, art, name, or
design from any other production is carried into the bit —
mechanisms only, per the construction-kit rule
(show/WORKING-METHOD.md).

## 2. THE RULES (owner's, in substance)

1. **Interchangeable dressing.** The background colour and the
   cute background business change every time. No two instances
   share a dressing by default.
2. **The lineup varies.** Composition is per-instance: a human
   with their party, an all-Mochiichao team, one Mochiichao
   alone, one human alone, two humans, or two, three, or four
   Mochiichao. The lineup is chosen per episode, not fixed.
3. **Personality beats.** Individual characters carry little
   gags of their own inside the bit — small actions that show
   their personality, and the team's chemistry in miniature.
4. **The weighting.** The plain walking line is the signature
   form: it carries **40–50% of instances**. The remaining
   50–60% are the varied forms — other activities, settings,
   and lineups under rules 1–3.

## 3. THE FENCE

An instance is built from **its own episode's cast** — the
people and Mochiichao that episode actually showed. Nobody is
added because they would be cute, and nobody appears in a form
the episode did not earn.

Amendment (owner, 2026-10-27, after the format was set): very
rarely, an instance may smuggle in an unseen or unintroduced
person, Mochiichao, or incident — in exactly two shapes,
**foreshadowing** (a tease of what is coming) or **flashback**
(a look back at a past person or incident) — and each smuggle
is individually owner-approved. Outside those two shapes and
that rarity, the fence stands as written. EP01's founding
instance (§4) uses no smuggle: the episode's own cast only.

## 4. INSTANCE HISTORY

### EP01 — "The Garden Has a Ghost" — instance 1 (2026-10-27)

- **Owner-given name: "Outro Credit Gag Number One"** — named by
  the owner on approving the instance (2026-10-27).

- **Slot:** the ED chibi credits-bit slot, window **56–70 s** of
  the 75 s ED (per EP01-V3-staging.json). Built length 14.000 s,
  filling the window.
- **Form:** the signature plain walking line (rule 4).
- **Lineup (episode's own cast only):** Mochiko in front —
  Mochii — Kittember — Sproutle — Wispkin trailing. Cast read
  from EP01's landed episode record: Mochiko is the episode's
  on-screen keeper; Aeon is never shown in EP01 (a device ping
  only) and is excluded; Dorowani (Hex's partner) and Gabu stay
  out to hold the format's lineup size. Personality beats:
  Mochii squash-hops, Kittember's tail-tip flame rides behind,
  Sproutle's sprout wobbles, Wispkin floats instead of walking
  at the rear.
- **Dressing (rule 1):** flat dusk-plum field, pale stars, a
  crescent moon, a scalloped ground band with tiny flowers.
- **Files:** `EP01-ED-GAG-v1.mp4` (instance of record,
  1280×720, 24 fps, 14.000 s, sha256
  f81ae4ef1ffca6898c04f542411fc35d33e1c51fff2a3f460fe409fbf24fe1ef)
  and `EP01-ED-GAG-v1-canvas.transparent.webm` (the alpha walk
  canvas it was composited from, sha256
  0e16f18d4484f12428bbb429afa7ec37175c93600192a8330fdd4a5f03a3c068).
  Workspace home: `~/workspace/ep01-ed-gag/` (build notes there);
  staged for TeraBox with the EP01 set (`EP01-MANIFEST.txt` in
  the TeraBox upload set).
- **v2 — the animation upgrade (owner-ordered 2026-10-27):**
  `EP01-ED-GAG-v2.mp4` (1280×720, 24 fps, 14.000 s, sha256
  503cd42e885948260a2b64088955d83dc95f2e5488f105404e8bba7ae05041fa)
  and `EP01-ED-GAG-v2-canvas.transparent.webm` (the alpha walk
  canvas it was composited from, sha256
  5435a5cfcbe67397f815ae5a3d2b309d1cdf3e74cdcee85ec934007481dd5bd1).
  Same instance, cast, lineup, dressing, and slot as v1; the
  motion is rebuilt as authored stepped frame animation — pose
  charts rendered from the rigs, each drawing held 3 frames
  (8 poses/second) — per the studied limited-animation method.
  Build record: `BUILD-NOTES-v2.md` in the workspace home above.
- **v3 — the leg-phase fix (owner-flagged 2026-10-27):**
  `EP01-ED-GAG-v3.mp4` (1280×720, 24 fps, 14.000 s, sha256
  5919bd7b035b3bfc360296b888dc9ad12fc277dda57060274a21ae5a6bd6b035)
  and `EP01-ED-GAG-v3-canvas.transparent.webm` (sha256
  663976c8eb72eff888236ee8842a4596caa3565e92cfa2527f4e95e56e6faf37).
  Same instance, cast, lineup, beats, dressing, slot, and on-3s
  timing as v2; the only change is Mochiko's walk cycle. The owner
  flagged that one leg cycled backwards — her left leg, on the
  viewer's right. Diagnosis and fix are measured, not asserted
  (build record: `BUILD-NOTES-v3.md` in the workspace home above):
  forward kinematics over the v2 rig data showed her left leg
  contacting at pose 3, snapping 201 units backward at pose 4,
  then sweeping forward while planted through poses 5–7 — the
  second half-cycle had been built by mirroring, which reverses a
  limb's sweep on an unflipped front-facing rig. v3 rebuilds
  poses 4–7 by role-swap (limbs exchange roles keeping their
  rotational sense; body tilts keep the mirrored alternation).
  Verified: both legs pass a monotonic phase check (stance sweeps
  back only, swing sweeps forward only), legs in opposite phase,
  the 201-unit snap is gone (largest step now 125, the natural
  swing stride), and the stepped timing is unchanged (224/335
  frame pairs held, 66.9% — v2's exact figure). Marked pose
  strips with her left shoe ringed red are in the build record's
  workspace (`work/v3/strips/`).
- **v4 — the foot-orientation fix (owner-flagged 2026-10-27):**
  `EP01-ED-GAG-v4.mp4` (1280×720, 24 fps, 14.000 s, sha256
  bb6ca004b0c8e8d503b4194c44c4df85f0f4b594ff969751ac0f7c2cd218c85e)
  and `EP01-ED-GAG-v4-canvas.transparent.webm` (sha256
  0612fb6458ba21b2b096a30a10f42301ff3de2dab309d30c99a3950be777c31f).
  Same instance, cast, lineup, beats, dressing, slot, and on-3s
  timing as v3; the only change is Mochiko's FOOT rotations. The
  owner studied v3's strip and split leg from foot: her left
  leg's foot looked backwards while the leg pointed correctly,
  and her right leg seemed to point wrong while its foot looked
  correct. Both observations were settled by measurement (build
  record: `BUILD-NOTES-v4.md` in the workspace home above). The
  leg bones sweep and lean correctly at every pose in v3 — his
  first observation's leg half, and the answer to his second:
  neither leg points wrong. The feet were the defect on both
  sides: measured on the skinned mesh, the shoe's toe tilt
  (degrees from straight down, + toward travel) ran NEGATIVE —
  toe against travel — in 4 of 8 poses per leg (her left: −19 at
  stance, −9 at her toe-off; her right: −15 at trailing stance,
  −4 at her toe-off), and on the renders the contact shoe
  streaked backward at the wide-stride poses (pose 4: 104 px of
  backward reach against 28 forward — the shared grid mesh
  stretches toward the other leg when the stride separates them,
  which is backward for the screen-right shoe and forward for
  the screen-left one: one artifact, opposite signs, which is
  why the two legs read so differently). v3's construction is
  also answered in the record: no leg was flipped individually —
  poses 4–7 exchange the limbs' roles keeping rotation signs,
  and the FOOT bones were part of that exchange. v4 authors the
  eight cycle poses' foot values explicitly (toe-offs at +22°,
  all other poses +3…+19°), leaving every other channel —
  legs included — byte-identical to v3, and tunes the
  wide-stride poses against the pixel measurement. Verified: a
  new foot checker (tilt ≥ 0° everywhere, ≥ +15° at toe-off)
  FAILS v3 on both legs and PASSES v4; v3's leg-phase checker
  re-run on v4 passes with ankle traces numerically identical
  to v3's; the backward streak at poses 3–5 is cut by more than
  half (104→44 px at pose 4), with a small residual recorded in
  the build notes as the grid-streak floor under foot-only
  levers; stepped timing unchanged (224/335 frame pairs held).
  Enlarged per-leg strips with toe-direction arrows are in the
  build workspace (`work/v4/strips/`).
- **Status: OWNER-APPROVED — v4 is the CANDIDATE CURRENT
  version.** The owner approved the instance on viewing v1
  (2026-10-27) and named it "Outro Credit Gag Number One"; v1
  stands as the first produced version. v2 (the owner-ordered
  animation upgrade) is SUPERSEDED AS CANDIDATE by v3 — reason:
  a leg-phase defect the owner spotted on viewing v2 (her left
  leg cycling backwards through poses 4–7), fixed and verified
  in v3 as recorded above. v3 is in turn SUPERSEDED AS
  CANDIDATE by v4 — reason: a foot-orientation defect the owner
  spotted studying v3's strip (her left foot reading backwards;
  her right foot segment slanting wrong at its trailing
  poses), fixed and verified in v4 as recorded above. v4 is
  the candidate current version pending the owner's viewing
  of it. The shipped EP01
  master is unchanged — it still carries the slot's empty
  placeholder frame. This instance swaps in only on the owner's
  order (Current-Version Law).

*Machinery note: the teardown lane's slot, fence, and format
systems (List 42 items 410/418–419; List 44's chibi-walk
systems) build the working apparatus under this record. This
document is the format's home; it does not duplicate their
specs.*
